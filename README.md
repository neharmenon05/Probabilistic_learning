# Probabilistic_learning
The project aims to **predict housing price categories** (Low, Medium, High, Luxury) using a **Bayesian Network model**.   It leverages **probabilistic reasoning** to handle uncertainty, missing data, and provide interpretable results rather than just a single-point prediction.
